# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

The notebook `lasso_randomforest_solution.ipynb` produces my solution for the [House Prices Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), which currently acheives a mean-squared error of 12% on the true testing house prices (75th percentile on leaderboard).

## Data

The training and testing data each consist of roughly 1500 recent house sales in Ames, Iowa. There are 79 feature columns including details of the condition, quality, and size of various areas of the house/lot, the number of bathrooms and fireplaces, and the material and style of the house exterior. The target for prediction is the sale price of the house.
